# internal/workflow/engine/

Persisted workflow item/phase FSM coordination, direct run start, project-local
resource semaphores, and startup recovery.

## Invariants

- The command-loop goroutine is the sole owner of mutable scheduler state and
  every FSM transition. Runner callbacks enqueue commands; they never mutate
  state directly.
- `teardown` is the only path that releases resource holders. Normal phase
  exit, parks, failures, cancellation, and crash sweep all use it. It is also
  the only caller of `Runner.Stop` (takeover uses `StopForTakeover`), so an
  agent session or a tool phase's process tree dies in the same place its
  resources are released — including the `runnerStarting` window, where an
  attempt that has not reported yet is still stopped by key.
- There is no queued state. `StartItem` admits an item straight to `running`
  and enters its first phase; back-pressure is a *phase* waiting on resource
  capacity, never an item waiting in line. `waiting` is a FIFO list of held
  phase starts, so freed capacity goes to the longest-waiting phase.
- Resource capacity comes from the live project profile at acquisition time.
  Acquisitions are sorted and all-or-nothing; names never contend across
  projects.
- Every agent-driver phase implicitly acquires `provider:<provider>` on top of
  its declared resources — the bound on concurrent CLI sessions. Capacity comes
  from the project profile like any other resource and falls back to
  `DefaultProviderCapacity` when undeclared; `provider:` is a reserved name
  prefix in `internal/workflow/profile` validation. A tool-driver phase never
  takes provider capacity, and a frozen agent phase with no provider is a
  wiring error rather than an unbounded start.
- Runner start failures are mapped to typed park reasons by sentinel, never by
  string matching: `ErrSetupFailed` → `setup-failed` (workspace provisioning,
  setup hooks, secret resolution, a process that would not start),
  `ErrWiringFailed` → `wiring-error` (the frozen definition and the live project
  profile cannot produce runnable work — an unbound check/command, a failed
  argv interpolation), everything else → `agent-error`. These are the same
  reasons the engine parks its own equivalents under — an unroutable gate or a
  phase missing from the snapshot is `wiring-error`, a failed resource
  acquisition is `setup-failed` — so a run's park reason does not depend on
  which side of the `Runner` boundary noticed. A new runner failure mode picks
  one of these sentinels or adds one here; it does not fall through to
  `agent-error` by accident.
- Global pause is one engine-level flag (`Pause`, persisted by the app in
  settings and restored through `Config.Paused`). While paused no phase starts
  anywhere; in-flight turns run to completion and their items rest at the next
  phase boundary, still `running` with a held phase start — this is not
  `needs-human`. Unpause replays the held starts through the one
  `startWaiting` release path.
- SQLite is the recovery journal. Startup iterates projects, rebuilds running
  and parked items, and parks interrupted running attempts rather than
  re-running them. Parked and terminal items are evicted from memory; resume
  loads a parked item from SQLite on demand.
- `Answer` is valid only for `needs-human(question)`. It persists a new phase
  attempt whose feedback carries the answer and sets `RunRequest.PriorThreadID`
  from the parked attempt so the runner continues the same provider session.
- `TakeOver` parks a live or parked attempt as `needs-human(taken-over)` through
  teardown, releasing resources and runner timers without touching its
  worktree/provider history. `CompleteTakeover` creates one finalize attempt on
  that same thread; validation exhaustion re-parks as `taken-over`.
- `RerunFailed` is the only `failed → running` edge. It re-stamps the run start
  before the transition and carries the previous attempt's failure feedback into
  the new one; the attempt begins immediately, subject to resources and pause.
- Done-item disposition parking is an item lifecycle action in
  `item_actions.go` and stays serialized through the command loop.
- Per-item budgets are checked before every phase attempt. Item overrides win
  over live profile defaults; token/USD spend comes through `SpendSource`, and
  wall clock uses the engine clock against the persisted item start time.
- Worktree provisioning, setup hooks, artifact copying, and cleanup execution
  stay runner/app-owned. The engine only maps typed setup failures and parks
  step-mode automatic decisions without rewriting their persisted gate trace.
- `Runner.Start` runs on a worker goroutine. Its keyed result re-enters the
  command loop before mutating FSM state, while the initiating API caller waits
  outside the owner loop so cancellation and unrelated commands remain live.
- Cleanup policy is plumbing only until disposition lands: read-only workflows
  have no worktree, and writing workflows retain theirs in every terminal state.
- A phase's `access` declaration is enforced at the provider session, not only
  used to derive workspace need. `def.Phase.EffectiveAccess()` is the single
  predicate behind both: `write` → `provider.RuntimeFullAccess` (full access
  inside the run's isolated workspace), `read-only` or unset →
  `provider.RuntimeReadOnly` (mutations denied outright, never prompted). Unset
  means read-only on both axes, so an unannotated phase can only ever be
  under-privileged. The mapping is stamped onto the phase thread row at
  creation (`createWorkflowThread`), which makes it survive restarts, resumes,
  and `Answer` continuations for free — `SessionOptions` are re-derived from
  the row every time. A writing phase in the graph means every phase shares the
  worktree, so workspace is NOT a proxy for access. Tool-driver phases hold no
  provider session; for them `access` affects workspace derivation only, and
  nothing pretends otherwise. An agent phase pinned to a provider that cannot
  apply a runtime mode (`provider.Capabilities.EnforcesRuntimeMode` false) is
  refused with `ErrWiringFailed` rather than started with an inert declaration.

## Boundaries

- Provider and app/channel implementations live behind `Runner` and `Emitter`.
- Workflow resolution and project-profile loading live behind their narrow
  sources. The frozen `Snapshot` pins definitions, never profile capacities.
- No timers, watchdogs, retry backoff, worktree setup, or transport/app wiring
  belongs in this package. Reliability timers and sub-attempt retries are
  runner-owned; the engine only checks phase-boundary budgets and maps outcomes.
- Persisting the pause flag and emitting it to the frontend is app wiring. The
  engine owns the live flag and the `workflow:engine-state` payload shape.
